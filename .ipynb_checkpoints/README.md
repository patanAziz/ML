🤖 ML — Basic Machine Learning Projects
Welcome to the ML repository! This collection contains beginner-to-intermediate level machine learning projects focusing on core concepts such as Regression, Classification, and Clustering. Each project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization — all designed to strengthen your practical understanding of ML algorithms.

📁 Project List
🔢 Regression
Linear Regression: Predicting continuous variables (e.g., housing prices)

Polynomial Regression: Capturing non-linear relationships

Ridge and Lasso Regression: Regularization techniques to reduce overfitting

🧮 Classification
Logistic Regression: Binary classification problems

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Intuitive instance-based learning

Decision Tree / Random Forest: Tree-based classifiers

Support Vector Machine (SVM): High-margin classifiers

Naive Bayes: Probabilistic classification, good for NLP

🔍 Clustering
K-Means Clustering: Grouping similar data points

Hierarchical Clustering: Dendrogram-based clustering

DBSCAN: Density-based clustering for noisy data

🛠️ Tech Stack
